usefull comands:

If you have defined some functions in a file called, say, myfunctions.hs, you load up those functions by typing in :l myfunctions and then you can play with them, provided myfunctions.hs is in the same folder from which ghci was invoked. If you change the .hs script, just run :l myfunctions again or do :r, which is equivalent because it reloads the current script.

set ghci as prompt:
:set prompt "ghci> "
